# **Graph Colouring Problem**

This program solves the Graph Colouring Problem using a heuristic algorithm. Given an undirected graph, the program assigns a color (represented as a letter) to each node such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color, using the smallest number of colors possible.

___
## **Program requirements**

Python 3.6 or higher \
Libraries: `sys`, `string`, `collections`

___
## **Usage**

1. Prepare an input file following the input specification described in the lab exercise pdf.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where program.py and input.txt are located.

3. To run the program, type the following command:

_```python3 program.py input.txt output.txt```_

Here, `input.txt` is the input file name and *`output.txt`* is the desired output file name. You can replace these with your own file names.

___
### **Example**

Input file:
```
1 2 3 4
2 1 4
3 1
4 1 2
```

Output file:
```
1A
2B
3B
4C
```

That's it! You have successfully run the Python code to solve the graph colouring problem using a heuristic algortihm.
